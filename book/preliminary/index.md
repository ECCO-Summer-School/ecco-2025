# What to Expect?

The 2025 ECCO Summer School will blend expert-led lectures, interactive tutorials, peer-to-peer learning, and collaborative team projects to provide a deep dive into the principles and applications of ocean state estimation. Each day we will have two science or technical talks, hands-on tutorial sessions, and four hours of "open project time". Students can use "open project time" however they wish, either individually or in teams, pursuing their own research interests or on projects proposed by the organizers or their peers.

## Suggested Prerequisites

Participants are encouraged to be familiar with Python-based computing in the geosciences as described on the [Pythia Foundations](https://foundations.projectpythia.org/landing-page.html) website. 

We can provide resources to participants wishing to brush up on their skills beforehand, however we will not be teaching these core concepts during the summer school.
