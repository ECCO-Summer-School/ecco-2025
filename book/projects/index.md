# Projects

As you prepare for the summer school, we encourage you to start thinking about a project you’d like to explore, either individually or in a team. This could be a question you’ve been curious about, a problem you’d like to solve, or a new method you want to learn and apply. Your project can be ambitious or exploratory, and you’ll have the opportunity to refine it as you engage with peers and mentors. Whether you already have a concrete idea or just a general direction, we invite you to come ready to collaborate, experiment, and make the most of this hands-on learning experience.
